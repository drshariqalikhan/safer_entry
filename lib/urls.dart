String tnc = "Although QRona Scanner is specifically made to work with Singapore's Safe Entry, It is not a Singapore Government Application. The application estimates the user’s proximity to places recently visited by Covid positive patients using the user’s phone’s GPS. At no time does any of the user’s information including GPS location every leave the user’s phone. Additionally, as the list of recently visited places by Covid positive patients is obtained from Singapore Government’s publicly available website daily, the developers bear no liability or responsibility to its accuracy.
